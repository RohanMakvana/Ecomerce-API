# Ecomerce-API
Basically this is a simple API. It doesn’t have all the fancy features of a modern E-Commerce web application but it does have all the basic features to get things started. You can surely add more features to make this better.

⨳ Prerequisites
    Basic understanding of javascript
    Basic knowledge of Nodejs, MongoDB, Mongoose and Express

⨳ The basic features in this API would be:

    Signing Up, signing in and signing out of users
    Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    Option to add, edit, view and delete all products in the store.
